## DRM Consumer Receivers

Since 2006, the digital audio broadcasting research and development team at Toncy has been dedicated to advancing digital broadcasting technology. We specialize in the development, manufacturing, and sales of digital audio broadcast receivers. Our team has successfully launched several consumer-grade digital audio receivers, including some global firsts that have pioneered new territories in digital audio broadcast receiver technology.

Our consumer receivers are designed for radio enthusiasts and everyday users alike, suitable for home use and portable enough for daily carry. They deliver a high-quality information consumption and entertainment experience with a focus on cost-effectiveness. For example, our DRM receivers are primarily aimed at serving vast or populous developing nations with affordable, high-quality information experiences. Following this philosophy, in recent years, we have introduced several models in the GR series, such as the GR-216 and the GR-224/226/228, including the GR-221.

Each of these receivers features a high-performance silicon tuner at its core, supporting medium wave, shortwave, and FM bands for DRM broadcasts, as well as Journaline data news services and DRM emergency broadcast alerts. Over the years, our products have been embraced by consumers globally, with sales extending across multiple countries and regions. They are widely used in DRM broadcast testing and remote education projects, earning acclaim from consumers, broadcasters, and regulatory bodies alike.
