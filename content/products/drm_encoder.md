## Toncy DRM Encoder / Multiplexer

The Toncy DRM Encoder / Multiplexer is a highly reliable professional broadcast system for Digital Radio Mondiale. It supports the content and signalling options DRM offers and all interfaces for a smooth integration into the broadcast chain. 

The system is typically located in the studio, at a play-out center or at the transmitter site â€“ with full remote control for administration and data provision, enabling cloud-based operation. The remote web interface featuring in-place-editing technology for quick and convenient system configuration can be accessed through any modern web browser, including individual user login via LDAP. 

The output signal of the Toncy DRM Encoder / Multiplexer carries the complete DRM Multiplex (FAC, SDC, MSC) in MDI/DCP format according to ETSI TS 102 820 (Multiplex Distribution Interface) and ETSI TS 102 821 (Distribution and Communications Protocol). This DRM Multiplex can be fed simultaneously to any number of DRM Modulators/transmitter sites (with timing support for SFN single frequency network operation), and monitoring stations.
