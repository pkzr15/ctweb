## DRM Emergency Receiver

In the field of emergency broadcasting, Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) exhibits significant advantages, particularly its ability to operate on medium wave and shortwave bands, enabling long-range broadcasting capabilities. This means that DRM broadcasts do not rely on local infrastructure, such as electricity and network services, making them unaffected by local disasters. When disasters occur, local broadcasting systems may cease to function due to personnel evacuations or infrastructure damage, but DRM can transmit emergency broadcast content directly from transmitters hundreds or even thousands of kilometers away. With features like area restriction and conditional access, DRM ensures precise information delivery. Additionally, DRM supports various data services including text, audio, images, and Journaline, catering to diverse emergency broadcast needs.

Toncy provides emergency broadcast receivers based on the DRM broadcasting standard, including options like public speakers or public signage, with customization available as required. With the assistance of emergency broadcast gateway adapters, these receivers can seamlessly integrate with emergency broadcast networks, receiving commands from government emergency broadcast networks and broadcasting emergency programs when disasters strike.
