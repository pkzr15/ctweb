**The headend system includes:**
- **DRM Encoder Multiplexer**: Responsible for encoding audio and data content and generating multiplex streams according to DRM standards, ensuring high-quality transmission of broadcast content.
- **DRM Exciter**: Converts DRM MDI/DCP format multiplex streams into I/Q or RF signals, adapting to modern digital broadcasting transmission requirements.
- **DRM Adapter**: Designed for traditional EER transmitters (such as PDM, DX, PSM), supports digital transformation, solves amplitude-phase modulation issues encountered during digitalization, and ensures precise timing alignment between audio and phase paths to improve transmission efficiency and signal quality.

**The receivers cover a variety of types:**
- **Consumer Receivers**: Provides daily users with the ability to listen to DRM/AM/FM broadcasts, designed to be portable and user-friendly.
- **Automotive Receivers and Modules**: Helps upgrade in-car entertainment systems to receive digital broadcasts, enhancing the in-car entertainment experience.
- **Monitoring Receivers**: As a distributed reception system, it is used for long-term monitoring of the quality of DRM digital broadcasts and operational data, ensuring the stability and reliability of broadcasting services.
