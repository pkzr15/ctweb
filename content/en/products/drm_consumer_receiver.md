## DRM Consumer Receivers

DRM (Digital Radio Mondiale) is a groundbreaking digital transmission system applicable to long wave, medium wave, short wave, and FM bands. Utilizing advanced signal encoding and compression techniques along with increased channel bandwidth, DRM significantly enhances the audio quality of AM and FM broadcasts. This technological leap is a potential game-changer for radio enthusiasts and broadcasters.

Toncy, a subsidiary of Gospell, has been actively involved in the development of DRM since 2006, continuing to innovate in this field. Our research and development team specializes in the advancement of digital broadcasting technology, focusing on the design, manufacturing, and sales of various DRM receivers. We were pioneers in launching multiple revolutionary DRM receivers globally and actively participate in broadcasting tests worldwide.

Our consumer receivers, such as the GR series including the GR-216, GR-224/226/228, and GR-221, are designed for both radio enthusiasts and everyday users. These models are suitable for home use and portable enough for daily carry, offering a high-quality information and entertainment experience. Featuring high-performance silicon tuners, they support medium wave, shortwave, and FM bands for DRM broadcasts, Journaline data news services, and DRM emergency broadcast alerts.

Our DRM radio are aimed at providing affordable, high-quality information experiences, especially in vast or populous developing nations. Over the years, our products have gained global recognition, with sales extending across multiple countries and regions. They are widely used in DRM broadcast testing and remote education projects, earning acclaim from consumers, broadcasters, and regulatory bodies alike.

We believe that DRM is the future of audio broadcasting, and we are continually working towards making this vision a reality.
