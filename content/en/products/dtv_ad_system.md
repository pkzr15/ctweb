## GS-9350 Advertising Broadcast System 5.1

GS-9350 Advertising Broadcast System 5.1 is a sophisticated software system capable of inserting various forms of advertisements into digital television streams. These advertisements can include scrolling subtitles in picture format, corner animations, menu images, prompt window images, set-top box startup images, channel change images, program banners, pop-up images, and background images for broadcast programs, as well as startup and menu videos. Through this system, operators can devise and execute advertising strategies, and manage and produce advertising content, ensuring that legitimate advertisements are broadcast across digital television networks according to specific requirements.

Compared to traditional advertising systems, the GS-9350 is divided into two main components: the Management System and the Broadcast System. The Broadcast System is deployed at the operator's front end and is solely responsible for transmitting advertisements to the digital television network. The Management System, on the other hand, can be hosted by an independent advertising service provider and is used to arrange and manage advertising content for multiple broadcast systems belonging to one or more operators. Additionally, the system supports the installation of both the Management and Broadcast Systems on the same server, offering a streamlined approach to advertising operations management.
