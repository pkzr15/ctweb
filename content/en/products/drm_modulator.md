## GQ-3770 DRM Modulator

The Toncy GQ-3770 DRM Modulator is a core device for DRM baseband processing based on an embedded platform. It is equipped with channel coding and OFDM modulation capabilities, capable of receiving MDI/DCP streams from DRM encoding multiplexers to generate I/Q signals in compliance with ETSI ES 201 980 standards. The Modulator includes functionality to reduce the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), effectively lowering the PAPR of OFDM signals, thus enhancing the output capability and efficiency of transmitters. Additionally, it features spectral shaping capabilities, with built-in windowing and filtering algorithms to ensure the output spectrum meets the ITU-R requirements for DRM broadcasts. The device supports multiple output modes, including I/Q or direct RF outputs, making it adaptable to various transmitter systems.
