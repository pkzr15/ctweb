## GQ-3680 series IPQAM Modulator

The Toncy GQ-3680 series represents a new generation of modular, high-density IP QAM products, integrating multiple functions within a compact 1U chassis. These functions include TS-over-UDP/RTP input and output, TS stream multiplexing, scrambling, PSI/SI processing, and modulation capabilities for 16/32/64/128/256QAM. When equipped with three plug-and-play 16-channel or 24-channel QAM module sub-cards, the GQ-3680 can support up to 48 or 72 modulated outputs, with each sub-card handling up to 2G bandwidth.

The GQ-3680 is designed for high reliability and stability, supporting 1+1 redundant hot-swap power supplies. Its sub-module design allows for flexible configuration and licensing, making the product highly scalable and adaptable. The GQ-3680 also supports remote monitoring and management via web and SNMP, significantly reducing management time and daily operational maintenance costs.

This IP QAM product offers a scalable, upgradeable, and highly reliable solution for operators. It is ideally suited for use in cable digital TV stations, sub-front end rooms, and VOD front ends, providing versatile deployment options.
