## GOSPELL VisionCrypt®

Gospell VisionCrypt is a comprehensive security solution tailored for content providers and broadcast operators across CATV, DTT, and DTH platforms. It facilitates both centralized and distributed deployments, ideal for large-scale pay-TV networks spanning vast geographic areas.

Gospell VisionCrypt CAS is engineered to ensure a completely secure content environment for broadcast operators. It encrypts control words and user authorization information within a highly secure and stable environment, fully compatible with the DVB Simul-Crypt standard. GOSPELL CAS has been rigorously tested and approved by SARFT, serving millions of subscribers and has been granted a Class A network access license. Additionally, it has earned the India BECIL certification.

Gospell VisionCrypt CAS incorporates a variety of content protection mechanisms to enhance operator investment. These include 3DES and AES encryption algorithms, smart card & STB binding, zone control, fingerprinting, dual-level encryption, and smart card distribution, among others. This robust framework ensures optimal security and operational efficiency for broadcasters.
